# Personal-Website
Hello. I am currently in an apprenticeship and therefore creating a Website with my Skills and Information about my personality.
This Website is still in progress and I am looking forward to host it as soon as possible. 

## Setup

For this Project I am using HTML 5 / CSS and vanilla JavaScript. It is actually a great oppertunaty to practice JavaScript because I really enjoy the logic and creativity behind 
Frontend develpment. 


## About Myself

I started Programming in August 2020. My "main language" is Python but since I learned OOP in Java, I am very facinated about it aswell. In autumn I visited a course about 
the basics of HTML and CSS. Since then, I used it often in smaller projects. This is one of them.
